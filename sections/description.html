        <p>MULTITTRUST is a workshop of <a href="https://hai-conference.net/hai2023/"  target="_blank" >HAI conference 2023</a>. Our
          workshop emerges from the need to connect the multidisciplinary research community that concentrates on
          examining the different aspects of trust in human-AI teams.
          With the rapid growth of these teams across varied industries, there is an increasing call for careful
          consideration of the challenges that come with it.
          Trust, a vital construct within mixed human-robot teams, has been studied extensively across disciplines,
          particularly in human-computer interaction and psychology.
          However, considering the complex dynamics and diverse team compositions, a comprehensive understanding of
          trust in human-AI teams remains elusive.

          This workshop is a second edition following its initial launch at the <a href="https://multittrust.github.io/"  target="_blank" >HHAI 2023 Conference in Munich</a>.            
          This second edition focuses on integrating knowledge across fields with the goal of enhancing computational methods
          to estimate trust in human-AI teams. We aim to facilitate meaningful conversations and collaborations among
          researchers from various disciplines, including psychology, sociology, cognitive science, computer science,
          artificial intelligence.</p>
